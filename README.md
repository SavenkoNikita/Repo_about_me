My name is *Nikita*, I am 30 years old. I am an aspiring **Python** developer.
I am currently working as a system administrator at a meat processing plant. Interest in programming appeared about 1.5 years ago. My first and only project is [telegram bot](https://github.com/SavenkoNikita/pythonProject_bot), which helps in working and learning Python in practice. I want to acquire the necessary skills in Netology for a confident start in a new profession.
